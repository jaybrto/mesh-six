# Dapr Components (Local Dev Copies)

These files are secondary copies kept for local `dapr run` usage only.

**The authoritative versions deployed by ArgoCD are in `k8s/base/dapr-components/`.**

If you update a component, edit the file in `k8s/base/dapr-components/` first,
then sync the change here manually.
