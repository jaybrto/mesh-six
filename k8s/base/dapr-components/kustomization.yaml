# Dapr component manifests for the mesh-six namespace.
#
# These files are the AUTHORITATIVE source deployed by ArgoCD.
# They were copied from dapr/components/ because Kustomize's load restrictor
# prevents referencing paths outside the kustomize root.
#
# If you modify a component, edit the file HERE (k8s/base/dapr-components/).
# The copies in dapr/components/ are kept only for local `dapr run` usage
# and must be kept in sync manually.
